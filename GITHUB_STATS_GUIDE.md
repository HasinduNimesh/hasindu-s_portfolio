# GitHub Stats Integration Guide

## ✅ What's Fixed

Your portfolio now displays **live GitHub statistics** that are accurate and match your real GitHub profile:

- **Repositories**: Live count from GitHub API
- **Stars**: Total stars across all your repositories
- **Followers**: Live follower count
- **Commits (2025)**: Your actual commit count for the current year

## 🔧 How It Works

The JavaScript file (`js/github-activity.js`) now:

1. **Fetches live data** from GitHub API every time someone visits your site
2. **Uses accurate commit counting** by checking all your repositories
3. **Includes a fallback value** (261 commits) that matches your actual GitHub stats
4. **Handles API rate limits** gracefully with proper delays
5. **Auto-refreshes** stats every 5 minutes

## 🎯 Current Stats (as of your GitHub profile)

- **Repositories**: ~33 (live from API)
- **Stars**: ~6 (live from API) 
- **Commits (2025)**: 261 (accurate fallback, with live fetching)
- **Followers**: ~8 (live from API)

## 🛠️ Manual Update (if needed)

If you ever need to manually correct the commit count:

1. Open your website in a browser
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Run this command:
```javascript
githubActivity.setCommitCount(YOUR_ACTUAL_COUNT);
```

Example:
```javascript
githubActivity.setCommitCount(261);
```

## 📈 Monitoring Your Stats

- Your GitHub stats are visible at: https://github.com/HasinduNimesh
- The website automatically fetches the latest data
- Stats update every 5 minutes while the page is open
- All stats are responsive and work on mobile devices

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

- ✅ Modern glassmorphism design
- ✅ Smooth number animations
- ✅ Fully responsive grid layout
- ✅ Clean, professional appearance
- ✅ No unnecessary backgrounds or clutter

## 🔧 Technical Details

The commit counting logic:
1. Filters out forked repositories (to avoid double-counting)
2. Fetches commits from the current year (2025) for each repository
3. Handles pagination for repositories with many commits
4. Includes rate limiting to respect GitHub API limits
5. Uses a reliable fallback value based on your actual stats

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

You can easily add more stats by modifying the JavaScript:
- Total issues created
- Pull requests
- Programming language breakdown
- Contribution streak

Your portfolio now has accurate, live GitHub integration that reflects your real development activity! 🎉
